# Contributing

If you are a developer and you wish to contribute, please read this document.

## Submitting a bug report

Make sure the bug is actually related to this project and not related to a libretro core implementation.

## Proposing changes

Contributions are only accepted via merge request. The process is simple, Fork invader, make any changes you think will move the project forward, and open a merge request.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before sending a merge request
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the CHANGELOG.md to the new version that this
   change would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
